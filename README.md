Hello, Iâ€™m Elif Demirci Kavlak
Thanks to my interest and curiosity in software testing, I have improved myself in the field of test automation. 
I enjoy optimizing test processes with Java and Selenium. I work to minimize errors and contribute to the development of higher-quality software. 
I am open to continuous learning, solution-oriented, and pay attention to details.
